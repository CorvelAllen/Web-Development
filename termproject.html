<h3>CUSTOMER TESTIMONALS</h3>
<p><blockquote>"I felt 100% confident by partnering with Robert"
— Heidi Fisher</blockquote>
I recently sold a house with Robert and while this can be a very stressful process, I felt 110% confident by partnering with Robert. He was candid, provided great feedback, helped explain clearly all details and managed the actual sale negotiation brilliantly. In addition, he was extremely responsive  to every one of my questions, no matter how small. As I move forward to now BUY my next house, I am extremely certain Robert will be the right partner to help me navigate this process.

<p><blockquote>"Robert is by far the BEST realtor we’ve worked with"
— Pierre Comeau</blockquote>
My wife & I have moved 6 times in the last 25 years. Obviously, we've dealt with many realtors both on the buying and selling side. I have to say that Robert is by far the BEST realtor we've ever worked with, his professionalism, personality, attention to detail, responsiveness and his ability to close the deal was Outstanding!!! If you are buying or selling a home, do yourselves a favor and hire Robert Greenberg!!</p><hr>
<p><blockquote>"He keeps his client’s best interests in sharp focus"
— Amanda Beal</blockquote>
After working with Robert to sell my home in 2013, I was convinced that he’s the only realtor I’ll ever need. Since then, I’ve bought two properties and sold one, and with each process, Robert’s knowledge, professionalism and terrific instincts have consistently guided us through to excellent outcomes. It is truly a pleasure to work with Robert – I’ve found that he keeps his client’s best interests in sharp focus and you can always trust that he is on top of every detail, big and small, which brings great peace of mind in any real estate transaction.</p>

<p><blockquote>"He is an excellent listener and negotiator"
— Abagael Long</blockquote>
Robert is an outstanding agent to work with. He is a skilled listener and negotiator, with very in-depth knowledge of the local markets. My husband and I listed two properties with him at the same time and while he sold one within a week, one took five months to sell. At no point in those five months did his dedication to selling the property waiver. He was just as aggressive and excited about selling the second property as he was the first. Without doubt, we would seek him out immediately for any upcoming real estate transaction in the future.</p>
<hr>
<p><blockquote>"Extremely competent in real estate transactions
— Mike Hildreth"</blockquote>
Robert has represented us on numerous real estate deals both buying and selling. He has shown right from the start that he is extremely competent in real estate transactions. We loved how he quickly responded to all of our questions as well as his knowledge of the whole process from start to finish. Finally, Robert is very well respected in the real estate community and I think that goes a long way when it comes to negotiations.</p>
